Task
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip),
and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.

meal price + meal price * 10% + mean price * tax%

double mealCost
int tipPercent, actual %
int taxPercent, actual %

totalCost, rounted int

12.00 + 12.00 * (20/100) + 12.00 * (8/100)
= 12.00 + 12.00 * 0.2 + 12.00 * 0.08
= 12.00 + 2.4 + 0.96
= 12.00 + 3.36
= 15.36
= 15 (r)
